NOTE: the original disclosure suggests that command injection is not feasible because the injection occurs after an "ORDER BY" clause, but it is likely that this bug could result in an error message path disclosure due to a syntax error, in some environments.  Therefore this is an exposure and should be included in CVE.
CVE-2005-4448	2005-12-21	n/a	FlatNuke 2.5.6 verifies authentication credentials based on an MD5 checksum of the admin name and the hashed password rather than the plaintext password, which allows attackers to gain privileges by obtaining the password hash (possibly via CVE-2005-2813), then calculating the credentials and including them in the secid cookie.

NOTE: it is possible that these are alternate vectors for the issue described in CVE-2005-4402.
CVE-2005-4457	2005-12-21	n/a	MailEnable Enterprise 1.1 before patch ME-10009 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via several "..." (triple dot) sequences in a UID FETCH command.

NOTE: the vendor has disputed this vulnerability, stating that the "XSS flaw was only part of the custom implementation of the [polopoly] site".  As of 20061003, CVE has no further information on this issue, except that the original researcher has a history of testing live sites and assuming that discoveries indicate vulnerabilities in the associated package

NOTE: on 20060227, the vendor disputed the accuracy of this report, saying that the p_news_id, news_and_events_new.asp, and news.asp are not specifically part of their product, although they could be dynamically generated through use of the product.  Some investigation by CVE suggests evidence that the news_and_events_new.asp page has at least a forced invalid SQL syntax error, but this could not be repeated for news.asp

NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that "WebDB is a generic online database system used by many of the clients of Lois Software. The flaw that was identified was some code that was added for a client to do some testing of his system and only certain safe commands were allowed. This code has now been removed and it is not now possible to use SQL queries as part of the query string.  No installation or patch is required All clients use a common code library and have their own front end and databases and connections. So as soon as a change / upgrade / enhancement is made to the code, all users of the software begin to use the latest changes immediately."  Since the issue appeared in a custom web site and no action is required on the part of customers, this issue should not be included in CVE
