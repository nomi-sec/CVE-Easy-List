CVE-2002-2439	2019-10-23	gcc	Integer overflow in the new[] operator in gcc before 4.8.0 allows attackers to have unspecified impacts.
CVE-2002-2443	2013-05-29	n/a	schpw.c in the kpasswd service in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.11.3 does not properly validate UDP packets before sending responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) via a forged packet that triggers a communication loop, as demonstrated by krb_pingpong.nasl, a related issue to CVE-1999-0103.
CVE-2002-2444	2019-10-28	n/a	Snoopy before 2.0.0 has a security hole in exec cURL
CVE-2002-2445	2015-08-04	n/a	GE Healthcare Millennium MG, NC, and MyoSIGHT has a default password of (1) root.genie for the root user, (2) "service." for the service user, (3) admin.genie for the admin user, (4) reboot for the reboot user, and (5) shutdown for the shutdown user, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.
CVE-2002-2446	2015-08-04	n/a	GE Healthcare Millennium MG, NC, and MyoSIGHT has a password of insite.genieacq for the insite account that cannot be changed without disabling product functionality for remote InSite support, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.
CVE-2002-20001	2021-11-11	n/a	The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a D(HE)at or D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.
