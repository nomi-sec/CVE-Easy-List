CVE-2012-6705	n/a	Cross Site Scripting (XSS) exists in Jamroom before 4.2.7 via the Status Update field.
CVE-2012-6706	n/a	A VMSF_DELTA memory corruption was discovered in unrar before 5.5.5, as used in Sophos Anti-Virus Threat Detection Engine before 3.37.2 and other products, that can lead to arbitrary code execution. An integer overflow can be caused in DataSize+CurChannel. The result is a negative value of the "DestPos" variable, which allows the attacker to write out of bounds when setting Mem[DestPos].
CVE-2012-6707	n/a	WordPress through 4.8.2 uses a weak MD5-based password hashing algorithm, which makes it easier for attackers to determine cleartext values by leveraging access to the hash values. NOTE: the approach to changing this may not be fully compatible with certain use cases, such as migration of a WordPress site from a web host that uses a recent PHP version to a different web host that uses PHP 5.2. These use cases are plausible (but very unlikely) based on statistics showing widespread deployment of WordPress with obsolete PHP versions.
CVE-2012-6708	n/a	jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.
CVE-2012-6709	n/a	ELinks 0.12 and Twibright Links 2.3 have Missing SSL Certificate Validation.
CVE-2012-6710	n/a	ext_find_user in eXtplorer through 2.1.2 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a password[]= (aka an empty array) in an action=login request to index.php.
CVE-2012-6711	n/a	A heap-based buffer overflow exists in GNU Bash before 4.3 when wide characters, not supported by the current locale set in the LC_CTYPE environment variable, are printed through the echo built-in function. A local attacker, who can provide data to print through the "echo -e" built-in function, may use this flaw to crash a script or execute code with the privileges of the bash process. This occurs because ansicstr() in lib/sh/strtrans.c mishandles u32cconv().
CVE-2012-6712	n/a	In the Linux kernel before 3.4, a buffer overflow occurs in drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-agn-sta.c, which will cause at least memory corruption.
CVE-2012-6713	n/a	The job-manager plugin before 0.7.19 for WordPress has multiple XSS issues.
